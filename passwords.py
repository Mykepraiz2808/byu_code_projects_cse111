# Password Strength Checker
# Author: [Michael Omofemiwa]
# Description: This program evaluates the strength of user-entered passwords based on length, character variety,
# and presence in known weak password lists. Includes optional feature to track weak password count.

# Constants for character sets
LOWER = list("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")
UPPER = list("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ")
DIGITS = list("0123456789")
SPECIAL = list("!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:'\",.<>?/`~")

                file_word = line.strip()
                if (case_sensitive and word == file_word) or (not case_sensitive and word.lower() == file_word.lower()):
                    return True
        return False
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File '{filename}' not found.")
        return False

# ‚úÖ Function 5: Check if a word contains any character from a character list
